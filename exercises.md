i'm compiling a list of programming exercises based on what i think is the best way to learn. the core idea is repetition with minor variation and a very gradual, incremental increase in difficulty. at some point i might turn it into something like [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) where you have to make the tests pass to progress to the next level.
