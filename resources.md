how computers actually work.

### videos

* [__Crash Course Computer Science__](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo): #5 (Representing Numbers and Letters in Binary) to #8 (Instructions & Programs) for hardware. #18 (Operating Systems) and #19 (Memory & Storage) for the basics of operating systems.  or just watch the whole thing.

* [__Hardware Basics__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-KUm9YpPm0) and [__Operating System Basics__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GDX-IyZ_C8): pretty dry but you might prefer that if you don't like the crash course videos.
